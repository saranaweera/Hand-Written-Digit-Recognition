# Handwritten Digit Recognition #

In this project, I use various machine learning algorithms and techniques to develop models to correctly classify hand written arabic numerals.

Dataset used for this project is the famous MNIST Database, compiled by Dr.Yann LeCun, Dr.Corinna Cortes, and Dr.Christopher J.C. Burges. Dataset contains 70,000 images with nearly equal number of examples for each of the ten different digits 0 through 9.
